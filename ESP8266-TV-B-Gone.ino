------------------------------------------------------------
CIRCUIT:
------------------------------------------------------------
-NB: SEE "main.h" TO VERIFY DEFINED PINS TO USE
The hardware for this project uses a wemos D1 mini ESP8266-based board:
 Connect an IR LED to pin 14 / D5 (IRLED).
 Uses the built-in LED via pin 2.
 Connect a push-button between pin 12 / D6 (TRIGGER) and ground.
 Pin 5 / D1 (REGIONSWITCH) must be left floating for North America, or wire it to ground to have it output European codes.

More about the wiring is written in the readme.

/*
This project transmits a bunch of TV POWER codes, one right after the other,
 with a pause in between each.  (To have a visible indication that it is
 transmitting, it also pulses a visible LED once each time a POWER code is
 transmitted.)  That is all TV-B-Gone does.  The tricky part of TV-B-Gone
 was collecting all of the POWER codes, and getting rid of the duplicates and
 near-duplicates (because if there is a duplicate, then one POWER code will
 turn a TV off, and the duplicate will turn it on again (which we certainly
 do not want).  I have compiled the most popular codes with the
 duplicates eliminated, both for North America (which is the same as Asia, as
 far as POWER codes are concerned -- even though much of Asia USES PAL video)
 and for Europe (which works for Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and
 other parts of the world that use PAL video).

 Before creating a TV-B-Gone Kit, I originally started this project by hacking
 the MiniPOV kit.  This presents a limitation, based on the size of
 the Atmel ATtiny2313 internal flash memory, which is 2KB.  With 2KB we can only
 fit about 7 POWER codes into the firmware's database of POWER codes.  However,
 the more codes the better! Which is why we chose the ATtiny85 for the
 TV-B-Gone Kit.

 This version of the firmware has the most popular 100+ POWER codes for
 North America and 100+ POWER codes for Europe. You can select which region
 to use by soldering a 10K pulldown resistor.

/* Legacy explanation from old Arduino Code for reference
The C compiler creates code that will transfer all constants into RAM when
 the microcontroller resets.  Since this firmware has a table (powerCodes)
 that is too large to transfer into RAM, the C compiler needs to be told to
 keep it in program memory space.  This is accomplished by the macro
 (this is used in the definition for powerCodes).  Since the C compiler assumes
 that constants are in RAM, rather than in program memory, when accessing
 powerCodes, we need to use the pgm_read_word() and pgm_read_byte macros, and
 we need to use powerCodes as an address.  This is done with PGM_P, defined
 below.
 For example, when we start a new powerCode, we first point to it with the
 following statement:
 PGM_P thecode_p = pgm_read_word(powerCodes+i);
 The next read from the powerCode is a byte that indicates the carrier
 frequency, read as follows:
 const uint8_t freq = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
 After that is a byte that tells us how many 'onTime/offTime' pairs we have:
 const uint8_t numpairs = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
 The next byte tells us the compression method. Since we are going to use a
 timing table to keep track of how to pulse the LED, and the tables are
 pretty short (usually only 4-8 entries), we can index into the table with only
 2 to 4 bits. Once we know the bit-packing-size we can decode the pairs
 const uint8_t bitcompression = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
 Subsequent reads from the powerCode are n bits (same as the packing size)
 that index into another table in ROM that actually stores the on/off times
 const PGM_P time_ptr = (PGM_P)pgm_read_word(code_ptr);
